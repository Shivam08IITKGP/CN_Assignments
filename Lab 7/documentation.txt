# CLDP Protocol Implementation Documentation

## 1. Overview
This document provides details about the implementation of the Custom Lightweight Discovery Protocol (CLDP) using raw sockets in C. The protocol allows servers to announce their presence and clients to query servers for metadata such as hostname and system time.

## 2. Requirements and Constraints
- The user must provide an IP address within the range `127.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`.
- Each server and client must have a unique IP address within the network.
- The query is sent once to the server, not periodically.
- The implementation strictly uses raw sockets (`AF_INET`, `SOCK_RAW`).
- The IP header is manually constructed, using protocol number `253`.
- No transport-layer protocols (TCP/UDP) are used.
- Elevated privileges (`sudo`) are required to run the program.

## 3. Files Included
- `cldp_client.c` - Implements the client that sends queries to servers.
- `cldp_server.c` - Implements the server that listens for queries and responds.
- `documentation.txt` - Provides build and run instructions.

## 4. Packet Format
Each CLDP packet consists of:
- **Message Type (1 byte)**: Defines the type of message (HELLO, QUERY, RESPONSE).
- **Payload Length (1 byte)**: Specifies the length of the payload.
- **Transaction ID (2 bytes)**: Unique identifier for tracking responses.
- **Reserved (4 bytes)**: Unused but reserved for future use.
- **Payload (variable length)**: Contains metadata (hostname, system time, etc.).

## 5. Implementation Details
### Client (`cldp_client.c`)
- Takes an IP address as input.
- Sends a **QUERY** message to known server IPs.
- Listens for **RESPONSE** messages and prints metadata.

### Server (`cldp_server.c`)
- Listens for **QUERY** messages on a raw socket.
- On receiving a query, sends a **RESPONSE** containing hostname and system time.

## 6. Running Instructions
### Compilation
```
gcc -o cldp_client cldp_client.c
gcc -o cldp_server cldp_server.c
```
### Execution
```
sudo ./cldp_server
sudo ./cldp_client hostname
OR
sudo ./cldp_client systime
OR
sudo ./cldp_client cpuload
OR
sudo ./cldp_client all
```

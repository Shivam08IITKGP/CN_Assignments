Custom Lightweight Discovery Protocol (CLDP) Documentation:
Protocol Specification
CLDP is a custom protocol designed for node discovery and metadata querying in closed network environments. It operates directly over IP (protocol number 253) without using transport-layer protocols.

Message Types
0x01: HELLO - Used by servers to announce their presence
0x02: QUERY - Sent by clients to request specific metadata
0x03: RESPONSE - Sent by servers containing requested metadata

CLDP Header Format
The CLDP header is 8 bytes with the following structure:
msg_type (1 byte): Message type identifier (HELLO, QUERY, RESPONSE)
payload_length (1 byte): Length of data following the header
transaction_id (2 bytes): Unique identifier to match queries with responses
reserved (4 bytes): Reserved for future use (currently set to 0)

Metadata Types
The implementation supports three types of metadata:
0x01: HOSTNAME - System hostname (256 bytes)
0x02: SYSTIME - Current system time (20 bytes)
0x03: CPULOAD - CPU load information (33 bytes)

Protocol Flow
Servers broadcast HELLO messages every 10 seconds
Clients discover servers by listening for HELLO messages
Clients send QUERY messages requesting specific metadata
Servers respond with the requested information in RESPONSE messages

Compilation
gcc -o cldp_server cldp_server.c
gcc -o cldp_client cldp_client.c

Running the Programs
# Start the server
sudo ./cldp_server
# In another terminal, run the client
sudo ./cldp_client query hostname
sudo ./cldp_client query systime
sudo ./cldp_client query cpuload
sudo ./cldp_client query all
